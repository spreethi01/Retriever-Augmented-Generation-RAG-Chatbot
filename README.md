# Retriever-Augmented-Generation-RAG-Chatbot
Code Implementation
1. Install Required Libraries
First, install the necessary libraries by running:


pip install openai faiss-cpu langchain streamlit PyPDF2


How It Works


PDF Upload: Users can upload multiple PDF files using the Streamlit interface.
Text Extraction: The system extracts text from the PDFs using PyPDF2.
Vector Indexing: The text is converted into vector embeddings and stored in a FAISS index.
Question Processing: User queries are processed by GPT-3.5 Turbo, augmented with relevant context retrieved from the FAISS index.
Answer Generation: The chatbot generates and displays accurate, contextually relevant answers.


Setup Instructions
API Key: Replace "your-openai-api-key" with your actual OpenAI API key.
Run the App: Save the code in a file, e.g., rag_chatbot.py, and run it with:
streamlit run rag_chatbot.py
Interact with the Chatbot: Upload PDFs, ask questions, and view responses.
